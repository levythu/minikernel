If you are reading this file, you probably don't need to.

This directory contains code which enables a Pebbles kernel
to boot multiple processors and communicate among them by
using inter-processor interrupts (IPIs).  This code is
provided for the curious or ambitious reader, but you should
be VERY CAREFUL that it doesn't distract you from accomplishing
what you need to get done to pass the kernel project, i.e. write
a complete and robust kernel.

Notes:

1. We expect you to consult "L36_P4.pdf" and "smp4.pdf" in
this directory.

2. It might be useful to refer to Intel's "MultiProcessor
Specification, Version 1.4 (May 1997)".
