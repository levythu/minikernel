To build the "hello" guest kernel from source:

0. If you already have a test program called "hello",
   make sure to remove it from STUDENTTESTS in your
   config.mk.

1. edit config.mk so your STUDENTGUESTS directive
   contains "hello" (initially you will not have
   such a directive, so you will need to add one).

2. cd guests

3. tar xpvfz $HOME/410/Web/p4/proj4.tar.gz

4. mv p4 hello

5. (cd hello && ./update.sh)

5. cd ..

6. (cd 410guests/hello && tar cf - .) | (cd guests/hello && tar xpf -)

7. Upgrade hello/kern/hvstubs.S so it does something.

8. make

The file "temp/hello" should be created, and when you boot
your kernel and do "ls" you should see "hello".

If you happen to want to build a guest kernel from source
of your own (such as your P1), the steps are similar (we
expect you can figure them out).
